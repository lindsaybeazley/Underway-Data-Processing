
OBJECTIVE:
# read, format and remove bad data all log files from underway flow through system aboard CCGS HUDSON  
# writes one csv file per log file with the name xxxxdata_yyyymmdd.csv 
# assuming the log file name is xxxx_yyyymmdd.CSV which is saved once per day per data type (xxx) NMEA, flow, TSG, PCO2


VERSIONS:

RStudio - Version 1.2.1335

FOLDER STRUCTURE:

code_readTSGdata - contains all code and functions and log files ouput from code 

rawdata - CSV text files logged by the TSG includes a log file saved once per day per data type; 
		NMEA, flow, TSG data, PCO2 data. Example; NMEA_20210918.CSV, FLOW_20210918.CSV, PCO2_20210918.CSV, TSGOUT_20210918.CSV
		
processed - the same log files in the rawdata but formated with some bad data removed.  Files are renamed to;  
		TSGposition_20210918.CSV, FLOWdata_20210918.CSV, PCO2data_20210918.CSV, TSGadta_20210918.CSV


STEPS TO RUN THE CODE:	

Insure all TSG log files are in the folder rawdata and 
Create the folder processed 
update the paths in each script for the variables; pathrawdata,  pathprocessed
Run each of these scripts the order does not matter.
