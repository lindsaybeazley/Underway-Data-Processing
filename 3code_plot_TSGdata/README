
OBJECTIVE:
# Script to read interpolated data and plot map contour plots from underway flow 
# through system.  plots are saved in the \3code_plot_TSGdata folder
# The interpolated data file is output from the code 2TSG_interp.R and 
# saved in the \2code_interp_plot_TSGdata\hourly_TSG_dataplots with name HUDyyyyfff_TSG_hourly.csv

# output from the code is in the 3code_plot_TSGdata and includes:
# - one plot per variable of hourly interpolated data, named TSG_variable.png
# - a NetCDF file containing Topographic data

  
VERSIONS:

R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14 ucrt)
Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64
Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 19045)
RStudio - 2024.04.2 Build 764

SCRIPTS:

3TSGcontourplot.R

FUNCTIONS:
none


PACKAGES:

library(oce)
library(ocedata)

FOLDER STRUCTURE:

\1code_readTSGdata - functions to read and cleanup TSG log files and calculate oxygen saturation called from the script "1readTSGdata.R",
 output is saved in the processed folder

\raw - CSV text files logged by the TSG includes a log file saved once per day per data type; 
		NMEA, flow, TSG data, PCO2 data. Example; NMEA_20210918.CSV, FLOW_20210918.CSV, PCO2_20210918.CSV, TSGOUT_20210918.CSV
		
\processed - the same log files in the rawdata but formated and some bad data removed. 
			Files are the output from the code 1readTSGdata.R
			Files are renamed to;  TSGposition_20210918.CSV, FLOWdata_20210918.CSV, PCO2data_20210918.CSV, TSGadta_20210918.CSV.

\2code_interp_plot_TSGdata - contains functions to interpolate hourly and plot the processed data in the processed folder
						  output from the code in the 2code_interp_plot_TSGdata\hourly_TSG_dataplots folder

\2code_interp_plot_TSGdata\hourly_TSG_dataplots - contains the output from the code in the code_interp_plot_TSGdata folder includes;
   - one file per variable of hourly interpolated data, named TSG_xxxxdata_xxxx_HUDyyyyfff.csv 
   (where xxxx is variable and HUDyyyyfff is the mission number)
   - a file containing all the variables interpolated hourly, named HUDyyyyfff_TSG_hourly.csv
   - a plot of each variable versus time and versus longitude, named TSG_xxxxdata_xxxx_HUDyyyyfff.jpeg and  TSG_xxxx_long.jpeg, 
   - a map of station locations, named TSG_map.jpeg
 
\3code_plot_TSGdata\ - plots of the interpolated data created from the script "3TSGcontourplot.R"
		
STEPS TO RUN THE CODE:	

set working directory
insure file containing all the variables interpolated hourly, named HUDyyyyfff_TSG_hourly.csv is in \2code_interp_plot_TSGdata\hourly_TSG_dataplots 
#**NOTE may need to remove data from the interpolated data file when TSG is turned on and off throughout mission
Run this script 3TSGcontourplot.R
